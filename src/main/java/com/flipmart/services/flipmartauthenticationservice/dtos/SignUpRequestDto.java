/* Note:
 This class represents the data transfer object for user sign-up requests.
 It contains the necessary fields for a user to sign up, such as name, email, and password.
 The @Getter and @Setter annotations from Lombok are used to automatically generate the getter and setter methods for these fields.
 This DTO can be used in the controller layer to receive user sign-up requests and pass the data to the service layer for processing.
 It helps in separating the data representation from the entity model, making it easier to handle user input and validation.
 The class does not contain any business logic; it is purely a data container.
 This approach follows the principles of clean architecture and helps in maintaining a clear separation of concerns in the application.
 The use of DTOs also allows for easier serialization and deserialization of data, especially when dealing with APIs.
 Additionally, it can be extended in the future to include more fields or validation annotations as needed.
 This DTO can be used in conjunction with validation annotations to ensure that the data provided by the user meets the required criteria.
 For example, you can add annotations like @Email for the email field to ensure that it contains a valid email address.
 You can also add @NotBlank or @Size annotations to enforce constraints on the name and password fields.
 This helps in improving the robustness of the application by catching validation errors early in the request processing pipeline.
 Overall, this SignUpRequestDto class serves as a simple yet effective way to encapsulate user sign-up data and facilitate communication between different layers of the application.
 It can be easily serialized to JSON or other formats for API responses, making it a versatile component in the application's architecture.
 The use of Lombok annotations reduces boilerplate code, making the class concise and easier to read.
 This DTO can also be used in conjunction with a service class that handles the business logic for user registration.
 The service class can take this DTO as an input parameter in its sign-up method, process the data, and interact with the repository layer to save the user information in the database.
 This approach promotes a clean architecture by keeping the data representation separate from the business logic and persistence layer.
 In summary, the SignUpRequestDto class is a crucial part of the user registration process in the application.
 It provides a structured way to handle user input, ensures data validation, and facilitates communication between different layers of the application.
 It can be easily extended and modified as the application evolves, making it a flexible and maintainable component in the overall architecture.
 By using this DTO, developers can ensure that the user sign-up process is efficient, secure, and adheres to best practices in software design.
